The repo for BEngine(to be changed to menata)

to use this you need vs2013, the DXSDK and the dependecies which you can download from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2jaqL4BUN28SXR5bEhFRkRtdm8&authuser=0

you just need to extract the file to the root of the project and open the .sln in the build folder
