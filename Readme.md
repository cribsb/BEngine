The repo for BEngine(to be changed to menata)

to use this you need vs2013 (https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs), the DXSDK (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) and the dependecies which you can download from https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2jaqL4BUN28fkNKTWp6bnhFWWdSMVJfM2VfYmlMYVFUWWVmeXdFbDZBMWtBX21hUjVaaEk&usp=sharing

you just need to extract the dependecies file to the root of the project and open the .sln in the Engine/build folder
